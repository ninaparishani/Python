create a sqlite database called "yourname.db".
create a table in the database called "survey" with the following fields:

id PRIMARY
choice TEXT

Create a python application that runs in a loop. It first asks the user if they want to submit their favourite color. If they select yes, ask them what it is. Give them the selection of 1 - Black, 2 - White, 3 - Red, 4 - Blue, 5 - Green, or 9 - Quit.

If they make an invalid selection, tell them they have made an invalid selection and give them the color options again.

When they have submitted a valid color, insert it into the database. (insert it as "1 - Black" or "4 - Blue"

keep asking them if they want to submit their favourite color again, until they select no (this is the loop part)

When the program ends, query the results of all the colors that we submitted and output the totals for each.
